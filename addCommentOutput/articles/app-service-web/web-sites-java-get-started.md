This tutorial shows how to create a Java [web app in Azure](/documentation/services/web-sites/) by using the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.cn/). <!-- deleted by customization The Azure Management Portal is a web interface that you can use to manage Azure resources. -->

> [AZURE.NOTE] To complete this tutorial, you need a Windows Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can <!-- deleted by customization [activate your Visual Studio subscriber benefits][] or --> [sign up for a trial][].

## Java application options

There are several ways you can set up a Java application in an Azure web app. 

<!-- deleted by customization
1. Use a template from the Azure gallery.

	The Azure gallery includes templates that automatically create and configure Java web apps with Tomcat or Jetty web containers. The web containers that the templates set up are configurable. For more information, see the [Use a Java template from the Azure gallery](#marketplace) section of this tutorial.
 
1. Create an app and then configure **Application settings**.

	Azure provides several Tomcat and Jetty versions, with default configuration. If the application that you will be hosting will work with one of the built-in versions, this method of setting up a web container is the easiest but it lacks the configuration capabilities in other methods. For this method, you create an app in the Azure Management Portal, and then go to the app's **Application settings** blade to choose your version of Java along with the desired Java web container. When you use this method the app runs from the local hard drive that is used by the worker to host the app, which does not take disk space away from the tenant. When you use this model, you don't have access to edit files in this part of the file system, which means you can't do things like configure the *server.xml* file or place library files in the */lib* folder.  For more information, see the [Create and configure a Java web app](#appsettings) section later in this tutorial.

1. Create an app and then use the Azure configuration UI.

	Azure Websites provides several Tomcat and Jetty versions, with default configuration. If the application that you will be hosting will work with one of the built-in versions, this method of setting up a web container is the easiest but it lacks the configuration capabilities in other methods. For this method, you create an app in the Azure Management Portal, and then go to the app's **Configure** blade to choose your version of Java along with the desired Java web container. When you use this method the app runs from the local hard drive that is used by the worker to host the app, which does not take disk space away from the tenant. When you use this model, you don't have access to edit files in this part of the file system, which means you can't do things like configure the *server.xml* file or place library files in the */lib* folder.  For more information, see the [Create and configure a Java web site](#appsettings) section later in this tutorial.  
<!-- keep by customization: end -->
  
3. Create an app and then manually copy and edit configuration files 

	You might want to host a custom Java application that does not deploy in any of the web containers provided by Azure Web App.  For example, here are some reasons for doing this:
	
	* Your Java application requires a version of Tomcat or Jetty that isn't directly supported by Azure or provided in the gallery.
	* Your Java application takes HTTP requests and does not deploy as a WAR into a pre-existing web container.
	* You want to configure the web container from scratch yourself. 
	* You want to use a version of Java that isn't supported in Azure and want to upload it yourself.

	For cases like these, you can create an app using the Azure Management Portal, and then provide the appropriate runtime files manually. In this case the files will be counted against your storage space quotas for your App Service plan. For more information, see [Upload a custom Java web app to Azure](/documentation/articles/web-sites-java-custom-upload/).

## <a name="marketplace"></a> Use a Java template from the Azure gallery

This section shows how to use the Azure gallery to create a Java web app.  The same general flow can also be used to create a Java-based mobile or API app.  

1. Sign in to the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.cn/).

2. Click **New > Marketplace**.

	![](./media/web-sites-java-get-started/newmarketplace.png)

3. Click **Web + Mobile**.

	You might have to scroll left to see the **Marketplace** blade where you can select **Web + Mobile**.

4. In the search text box, enter the name of a Java application server, such as **Apache Tomcat** or **Jetty**, and then press Enter.

5. In the search results, click the Java application server.

	![](./media/web-sites-java-get-started/webmobilejetty.png)

6. In the first **Apache Tomcat** or **Jetty** blade, click **Create**.

	![](./media/web-sites-java-get-started/jettyblade.png)

7. In the next **Apache Tomcat** or **Jetty** blade, enter a name for the web app in the **Web app** box.

	This name must be unique in the chinacloudsites.cn domain because the URL of the web app will be {name}.chinacloudsites.cn. If the name you enter isn't unique, a red exclamation mark appears in the text box.

8. Select a **Resource Group** or create a new one.

	For more information about resource groups, see [Using the Azure Management Portal to manage your Azure resources](/documentation/articles/resource-group-portal).

9. Select an **App Service plan/Location** or create a new one.

	For more information about App Service plans, see [Azure App Service plans overview](/documentation/articles/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview)

10. Click **Create**.

	![](./media/web-sites-java-get-started/jettyportalcreate2.png)

	In a short time, typically less than a minute, Azure finishes creating the new web app.

11. Click **Web apps > {your new web app}**.

12. Click the **URL** to browse to the new site.

	![](./media/web-sites-java-get-started/jettyurl.png)

	Tomcat ships with a default set of pages so if you chose Tomcat, you see a page similar to the following example.

	![Web app using Apache Tomcat](./media/web-sites-java-get-started/tomcat.png)

	If you chose Jetty, you see a page similar to the following example. Jetty doesn't have a default page set, so the same JSP that is used for an empty Java site is reused here.

	![Web app using Jetty](./media/web-sites-java-get-started/jetty.png)

Now that you've created the web app with an app container, see the [Next steps](#next-steps) section for information about how to  upload your application to the web app.

This section shows how to create a web app and configure it for Java using the **Application settings** blade of the portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.cn/).

2. Click **New > Web + Mobile > Web App**.

	![](./media/web-sites-java-get-started/newwebapp.png)

4. Enter a name for the web app in the **Web app** box.

	This name must be unique in the chinacloudsites.cn domain because the URL of the web app will be {name}.chinacloudsites.cn. If the name you enter isn't unique, a red exclamation mark appears in the text box.

5. Select a **Resource Group** or create a new one.

	For more information about resource groups, see [Using the Azure Management Portal to manage your Azure resources](/documentation/articles/resource-group-portal).

6. Select an **App Service plan/Location** or create a new one.

	For more information about App Service plans, see [Azure App Service plans overview](/documentation/articles/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview)

7. Click **Create**.

	![](./media/web-sites-java-get-started/newwebapp2.png)
 
8. When the web app has been created, click **Web Apps > {your web app}**.
 
	![](./media/web-sites-java-get-started/selectwebapp.png)

9. In the **Web app** blade, click **Settings**.

10. Click **Application settings**.

11. Choose the desired **Java version**. 

12. Choose the desired **Java minor version**.  If you select **Newest**, your app will use the newest minor version that is available in Azure for that Java major version.

12. Choose the desired **Web container**. If you select a container name that starts with **Newest**, your app will be kept at the latest version of that web container major version that is available in Azure Web App. 

	![](./media/web-sites-java-get-started/versions.png)

13. Click **Save**.

	Within a few moments, your web app will become Java-based and configured to use the web container you selected.

14. Click **Web apps > {your new web app}**.

15. Click the **URL** to browse to the new site.

	The web page confirms that you have created a Java-based web app.
