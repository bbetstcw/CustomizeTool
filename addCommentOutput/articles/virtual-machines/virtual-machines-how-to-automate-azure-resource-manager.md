Azure Resource Manager simplifies the deployment and management of complex applications running on Azure infrastructure services. Many applications require a combination of compute, network, and storage resources, such as virtual network, Storage account, and virtual machines with network interfaces. Azure Resource Manager allows you to use or construct a JSON template to deploy and manage all these resources together as a single application.
