Are you curious about the array of NoSQL technologies available in Azure, but aren't sure how they differ from each other or the relational models available? Or maybe you've got specific data in mind, but aren't sure which NoSQL technology is best for your application. If so, take advantage of the key learnings David Chappell provides in this insightful whitepaper. 

This whitepaper walks you through the following:

 - Differentiating operational data, which is read and written by applications, from analytical data, which is used to provide business intelligence (BI), to help determine the right technology for your needs.
 - A quick review of relational technology.
 - An introduction to each of the Azure NoSQL technologies: DocumentDB, Table storage, HBase, and HDInsight.
 - A comparison of the NoSQL technologies and Azure SQL Database.

**Summary:** Azure offers a broad array of options for your NoSQL workloads, but it can be challenging to determine the differences between all of the options available. This document explains NoSQL technologies on Azure and how they differ in managing from relational models of managing your data.

Relational technology has long been the dominant approach for working with data. However, when you work with large amounts of different types of data, as is increasingly the case today, you are faced with new challenges for managing this data. Relational technology is sometimes the best fit and sometimes not the best fit for managing this data. This guide walks through the options, explaining what each one provides and why you might want to use it.
