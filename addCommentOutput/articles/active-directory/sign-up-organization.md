# Sign up for Azure as an organization

Until recently, you could only sign up for a new Windows Azure subscription using your Microsoft account (Windows Live ID). Azure now supports using either of the following two account methods to sign up:

* **Microsoft accounts** (created by you for personal use) - Provide access to all consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services, such as Outlook (Hotmail), Messenger, <!-- deleted by customization OneDrive --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> SkyDrive <!-- keep by customization: end -->, MSN, Xbox LIVE, or Office <!-- deleted by customization 365 --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> Live <!-- keep by customization: end -->. Signing up for <!-- deleted by customization an Outlook.com mailbox --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> Outlook <!-- keep by customization: end --> automatically creates a Microsoft account <!-- keep by customization: begin --> with an @Outlook.com address <!-- keep by customization: end -->. <!-- deleted by customization After --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> Once created, <!-- keep by customization: end --> a Microsoft account <!-- deleted by customization is created, it --> can be used to access consumer-related Microsoft cloud services <!-- deleted by customization or --><!-- keep by customization: begin --> and/or <!-- keep by customization: end --> Azure.

* **Work or school accounts** (issued by an admin for business/academic use) - Provide access to all small, medium, and enterprise business-level Microsoft cloud services, such as Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Office 365. When you sign up to one of these services as an organization, a cloud-based directory is automatically provisioned in Azure Active Directory to represent your organization.

	After this directory has been created, an admin can then create users and assign licenses to them based on which cloud service subscriptions they need access to, such as Azure.
