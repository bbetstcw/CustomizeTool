Every blob in Azure storage must reside in a container. The container forms part of the blob name. For example, `mycontainer` is the name of the container in these sample blob URIs:

	https://storagesample.blob.core.chinacloudapi.cn/mycontainer/photos/myphoto.jpg
A container name must be a valid DNS name, conforming to the following naming rules:

1. Container names must start with a letter or number, and can contain only letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.
1. Every dash (-) character must be immediately preceded and followed by a letter or number; consecutive dashes are not permitted in container names.
1. All letters in a container name must be lowercase.
1. Container names must be from 3 through 63 characters long.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Note that the name of a container must always be lowercase. If you include an upper-case letter in a container name, or otherwise violate the container naming rules, you may receive a 400 error (Bad Request).
