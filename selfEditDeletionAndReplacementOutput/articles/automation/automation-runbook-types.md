		## Graphical runbooks
		
		[Graphical runbooks](/documentation/articles/automation-runbook-types#graphical-runbooks) are created and edited with the graphical editor in the Azure Management Portal.  You can export them to a file and then import them into another automation account, but you cannot create or edit them with another tool.  Graphical runbooks generate PowerShell Workflow code, but you can't directly view or modify the code. Graphical runbooks cannot be converted to one of the [text formats](/documentation/articles/automation-runbook-types), nor can a text runbook be converted to graphical format.
		
		### Advantages
		
		- Create runbooks with minimal knowledge of [PowerShell Workflow](/documentation/articles/automation-powershell-workflow).
		- Visually represent management processes.
		- Use [checkpoints](/documentation/articles/automation-powershell-workflow#checkpoints) to resume runbook in case of error.
		- Use [parallel processing](/documentation/articles/automation-powershell-workflow#parallel-processing) to perform mulitple activities in parallel.
		- Can include other Graphical runbooks and PowerShell Workflow runbooks as child runbooks to create high level workflows.
