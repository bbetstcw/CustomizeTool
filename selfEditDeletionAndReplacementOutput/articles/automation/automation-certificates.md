		### Graphical runbook sample
		
		You add a **Get-AutomationCerticiate** to a graphical runbook by right-clicking on the certificate in the Library pane of the graphical editor and selecting **Add to canvas**.
		
		![](./media/automation-certificates/certificate-add-canvas.png)
		
		The following image shows an example of using a certificate in a graphical runbook.  This is the same example shown above for adding a certificate to a cloud service from a textual runbook.  
		
		This example uses the **UseConnectionObject** parameter set for the Send-**TwilioSMS activity** that uses a connection object for authentication to the service.  A [pipeline link](/documentation/articles/automation-graphical-authoring-intro#links-and-workflow) must be used here since a sequence link would return a collection containing containing a single object which the Connection parameter is not expecting.
