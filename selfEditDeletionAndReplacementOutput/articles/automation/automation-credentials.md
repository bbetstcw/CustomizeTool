		The following image shows an example of using a credential in a graphical runbook.  In this case, it is being used to provide authentication for a runbook to Azure resources as described in [Configuring authentication to Azure resources](#automation-configuring.md).  The first activity retrieves the credential that has access to the Azure subscription.  The **Add-AzureAccount** activity then uses this credential to provide authentication for any activities that come after it.  A [pipeline link](/documentation/articles/automation-graphical-authoring-intro#links-and-workflow) is here since **Get-AutomationPSCredential** is expecting a single object.
