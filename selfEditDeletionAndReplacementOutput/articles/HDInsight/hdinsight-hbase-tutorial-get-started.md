		1. Sign in to the [Azure Management Portal][azure-management-portal].
		2. Click **New** in the upper left corner, and then click **Data + Analytics**, **HDInsight**.
		3. Enter the following values:
		
			- **Cluster Name** - enter a name to identify this cluster
			- **Cluster Type** - HBase
			- **Cluster Operating System** - the HDInsight HBase cluster currently only available on Windows operating system
			- **Subscription** - select your Azure subscription used for provisioning this cluster
			- **Resource Group** - add or select an Azure resource group. For more information, see [Azure Resource Manager Overview](/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview)
			- **Configure the credentials** - for Windows based cluster, you can create a cluster user (a.k.a HTTP user, HTTP web service user) and a Remote Desktop user
			- **Data Source** - create a new Azure storage account or select an existing Azure storage account to be used as the default file system for the cluster. This Azure Storage account must be in the same location as the HDInsight HBase cluster
			- **Note Pricing Tiers** - select the number of region servers for the HBase cluster
		
				> [AZURE.WARNING] For high availability of HBase services, you must provision a cluster that contains at least **three** nodes. This ensures that, if one node goes down, the HBase data regions are available on other nodes.
		
				> If you are learning HBase, always choose 1 for the cluster size, and delete the cluster after each use to reduce the cost.
		
			- **Optional Configuration** - select the cluster version, configure Azure virtual network, configure Hive/Oozie metastore, configure Script actions, and add additional storage accounts.
		
		4. Click **Create**.

			The default HTTP USER NAME is admin. You can customize the name by using the CUSTOM CREATION option.
		
			An Azure storage account is required using the default HBase provision process. For instructions, see [How To Create a Storage Account][azure-create-storageaccount]. The custom create option gives the option to create a storage account with the cluster provision process.

		4. Click the checkmark icon in the lower right to create the HBase cluster.

		Currently, there are two way to access HBase. This section covers using the HBase shell. The next section covers using the .NET SDK.
		
		For most people, data appears in the tabular format:
		
		![hdinsight hbase tabular data][img-hbase-sample-data-tabular]
		
		In HBase which is an implementation of BigTable, the same data looks like:
		
		![hdinsight hbase bigtable data][img-hbase-sample-data-bigtable]
		
		It'll make more sense after you finish the next procedure.

		This section describes how to use the HBase shell to create HBase tables, add rows, and list rows. Here is the data you will use:
		
		![hdinsight hbase table data][img-hbase-sample-data-tabular]
		
		To access the HBase shell, you must first enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), and then make an RDP connection to the HBase cluster. For instructions, see [Manage Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using the Azure Management Portal][hdinsight-manage-portal].
