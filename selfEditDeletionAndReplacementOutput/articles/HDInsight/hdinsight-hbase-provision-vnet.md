		1. Sign in to the [preview portal](https://manage.windowsazure.cn).
		2. Click **NEW**, click **Networking**, and then click **Virtual network**.
		3. In **Select a deployment model**, select **Classic**, and then click **Create**.
		
			> [AZURE.NOTE] You cannot use a v1 (Classic,) Azure Virtual Network with HDInsight. The Virtual Network must be v2 (Azure Resource Manager,) in order for it to be listed as an option during the HDInsight cluster creation process in the Azure preview portal, or to be usable when creating a cluster from the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.
		> 
		> If you have resources on a v1 network, and you wish to make HDInsight directly accessible to those resources through a virtual network, see [Connecting classic VNets to new VNets](/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-arm-asm-s2s) for information on how to connect a v2 Virtual Network to a v1 Virtual Network. Once this connection is established, you can create the HDInsight cluster in the v2 Virtual Network.
		
		4. Type or select the following values:
		
			- **Name**: The name of your virtual network.
			- **Address space**:  Choose an address space for the virtual network that is large enough to provide addresses for all nodes in the cluster. Otherwise the provision will fail. For walking through this tutorial, you can use the default values. Click **OK** to save the changes.
			- **Resource group**: Select the resource group you created earlier in the tutorial.
			- **Subscription**: Select the Azure subscription you like to use for this virtual network.
			- **Location** - The location must be the same as the HBase cluster that you will create.
		
		5. Click **Create**.
		
		By default, the virtual network uses an internal Domain Name System (DNS) server provided by Azure. More advanced networking configurations with custom DNS servers are also supported. For detailed guidance, see [Name Resolution (DNS)](/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances).

		1. Sign in to the [Azure Management Portal][azure-portal].
		2. Click **NEW** in the bottom-left corner, click **NETWORK SERVICES**, click **VIRTUAL NETWORK**, and then click **QUICK CREATE**.
		3. Type or select the following values:
		
			- **Name** - The name of your virtual network.
			- **Address space** - Choose an address space for the virtual network that is large enough to provide addresses for all nodes in the cluster. Otherwise the provision will fail. For walking through this tutorial, you can pick any of the three choices. 
			- **Maximum VM count** - Choose one of the maximum virtual machine (VM) counts. This value determines the number of possible hosts (VMs) that can be created under the address space. For walking through this tutorial, **4096 [CIDR: /20]** is sufficient. 
			- **Location** - The location must be the same as the HBase cluster that you will create.
			- **DNS server** - This tutorial uses an internal Domain Name System (DNS) server provided by Azure, so you can choose **None**. More advanced networking configurations with custom DNS servers are also supported.
		4. Click **CREATE A VIRTUAL NETWORK** in the lower-right corner. The new virtual network name will appear in the list. Wait until the Status column shows **Created**.
		5. In the main pane, click the virtual network you just created.
		6. Click **DASHBOARD** on the top of the page.
		7. Under **quick glance**, make a note of the virtual network ID. You will need it when provisioning the HBase cluster.
		8. Click **CONFIGURE** on the top of the page.
		9. On the bottom of the page, the default subnet name is **Subnet-1**. You can optionally rename the subnet or add a new subnet for the HBase cluster. Make a note of the subnet name; you will need it when provisioning the cluster.
		10. Verify **CIDR(ADDRESS COUNT)** for the subnet that will be used for the cluster. The address count must be greater than the number of worker nodes plus seven (gateway: 2, head node: 2, Zookeeper: 3). For example, if you need a 10-node HBase cluster, the address count for the subnet must be greater than 17 (10+7). Otherwise the deployment will fail.
		11. Click **Save** on the bottom of the page, if you have updated the subnet values.

		**To create an HDInsight cluster**
		
		1. Sign in to the [Azure preview portal](https://manage.windowsazure.cn).
		2. Click **NEW**, Click **Data Analytics**, and then click **HDInsight**.
		
		    ![Creating a new cluster in the Azure preview portal](./media/hdinsight-provision-clusters/HDI.CreateCluster.1.png "Creating a new cluster in the Azure Preview Portal")
		
		3. Type or select the following values:
		
		  - **Cluster Name**: Enter a name for the cluster. A green check will appear beside the cluster name if the name is available.
		  - **Cluster Type**: Select **HBase**.
		  - **Cluster Operating System**: Select **Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter**.
		  - **Subscription**: Select the Azure subscription that will be used for provision this cluster.
		  - **Resource Group**: Select the resource group you created earlier in the tutorial.
		  - **Credentials**: Configure the username and the password for the Hadoop user (HTTP user). If you enable remote desktop for the cluster, you will need to configure the remote desktop user username and password, and an account expiration date. Click **Select** at the bottom to save the changes.
		  - **Data Source**: Select an existing or create a new Azure Storage account that will be used as the default file system for the cluster. The default name for the default container is the cluster name.  The location of the storage account also determine the location of the cluster.
		  - **Node Pricing Tier**: For learning or evaluation purpose, select 1 region node to minimize the cost.
		
		  	- **Selection Method**: Set this to **From all subscriptions** to enable browsing of storage accounts from all your subscriptions. Set this to **Access Key** if you want to enter the **Storage Name** and **Access Key** of an existing storage account.
		  	- **Select storage account / Create New**: Click **Select storage account** to browse and select an existing storage account you want to associate with the cluster. Or, click **Create New** to create a new storage account. Use the field that appears to enter the name of the storage account. A green check will appear if the name is available.
		    - **Choose Default Container**: Use this to enter the name of the default container to use for the cluster. While you can enter any name here, we recommend using the same name as the cluster so that you can easily recognize that the container is used for this specific cluster.
		  	- **Location**: The geographic region that the storage account is in, or will be created in. This location will determine the cluster location.  The cluster and its default storage account must co-locate in the same Azure data center.
		
		  - **Node Pricing Tiers**: Set the number of worker nodes that you need for the cluster. The estimated cost of the cluster will be shown within the blade.
			- **Optional Configuration**: For this tutorial, you only need to configure **Virtual Network**.  Select the virtual network you created earlier in the tutorial. Make sure you also select a subnet.

If a container with the name of the cluster already exists, a sequence number will be appended to the container name. For example, mycontainer1, mycontainer2, and so on. However, if the existing Storage account has a container with a name different from the cluster name you specified, you can use that container as well.</p>

Each additional Storage account you specify adds an extra <strong>Storage Account</strong> page to the wizard where you can specify the account information. For example, in the screenshot above, no additional storage account is selected, and hence an extra page is not added to the wizard.</td></tr>
