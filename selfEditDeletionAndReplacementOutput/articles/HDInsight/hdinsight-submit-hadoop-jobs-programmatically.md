		The following procedure only works on HDInsight clusters on Windows. C# streaming is not supported on Linux clusters yet. However you can use .NET program to submit stream job written in other programming languages that are supported by Linux clusters. For example Python.  For an Python streaming example, see [Develop Python streaming programs for HDInsight](/documentation/articles/hdinsight-hadoop-streaming-python).
