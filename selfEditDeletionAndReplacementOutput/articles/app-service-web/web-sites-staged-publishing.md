		## Configure Auto Swap for your web app ##
		
		Auto Swap streamlines DevOps scenarios where you want to continuously deploy your web app with zero cold start and zero downtime for end customers of the web app. When a deployment slot is configured for Auto Swap into production, every time you push your code update to that slot, Azure Websites will automatically swap the web app into production after it has already warmed up in the slot.
		
		>[AZURE.IMPORTANT] When you enable Auto Swap for a slot, make sure the slot configuration is exactly the configuration intended for the target slot (usually the production slot).
		
		Configuring Auto Swap for a slot is easy. Follow the steps below:
		
		1. In the **Deployment Slots** blade, select a non-production slot, click **Configure** for that slot's blade.  
		
			![][Autoswap1]
		
		2. Click **Application Settings**. Select **On** for **Auto Swap**, select the desired target slot in **Auto Swap Slot**, and click **Save** in the command bar. Make sure configuration for the slot is exactly the configuration intended for the target slot.
		
			The **Notifications** tab will flash a green **SUCCESS** once the operation is complete.
		
			![][Autoswap2]
		
			>[AZURE.NOTE] To test Auto Swap for your web app, you can first select a non-production target slot in **Auto Swap Slot** to become familiar with the feature.  
		
		3. Execute a code push to that deployment slot. Auto Swap will happen after a short time and the update will be reflected at your target slot's URL.

		5. Click the app URL in the slot's blade. Notice the the deployment slot has its own hostname and is also a live app. To limit public access to the deployment slot, see [Azure Websites Web App – block web access to non-production deployment slots](http://ruslany.net/2014/04/azure-web-sites-block-web-access-to-non-production-deployment-slots/).
