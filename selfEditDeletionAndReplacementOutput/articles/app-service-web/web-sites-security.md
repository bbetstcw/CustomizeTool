		2. Select **Browse All**.
		3. From the **Browse** blade, select **Web Apps**.
		4. From the **Web Apps** blade, Select the desired web app.
		5. From the web app's blade, select **All settings**.
		6. From the **Settings** blade, select **Properties**.
		7. The FTP and FTPS links are provided on the **Settings** blade.
