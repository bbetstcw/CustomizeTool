		3. In the **Configure Windows Azure Web App Settings** dialog box, enter a **Web App name** that is unique in the *chinacloudsites.cn* domain. For example, you can name it MyExample with numbers to the right to make it unique, such as MyExample810. If a default web name is created for you, it will be unique and you can use that.
		
			If someone else has already used the name that you enter, you'll see a red exclamation mark to the right instead of a green check mark, and you'll need to enter a different name.
		
			Azure will use this name as the prefix for your application's URL. The complete URL will consist of this name plus *.chinacloudsites.cn* (as shown next to the **Web App name** text box). For example, if the name is `MyExample810`, the URL will be `MyExample810.chinacloudsites.cn`. The URL has to be unique.
		
		4. In the **App Service plan** drop-down, select **Create new App Service plan**.

For example, if the site name is `MyExample6442`, the URL will be `MyExample6442.chinacloudsites.cn`. The URL has to be unique. If someone else has already used the one you entered, you'll see a red exclamation mark to the right instead of a green check mark, and you'll need to enter a different site name.
