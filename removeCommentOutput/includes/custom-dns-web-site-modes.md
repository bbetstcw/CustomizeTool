Setting a custom domain name is only available for the **Shared**, **Basic** and **Standard** modes for web sites. Before switching a web site from the **Free** mode to the **Shared**, **Basic** or **Standard** mode, you must first remove spending caps in place for your web sites subscription. 

For more information on the App Service plan modes, including how to change the mode of your site, see [How to scale web sites](/documentation/articles/web-sites-scale).
