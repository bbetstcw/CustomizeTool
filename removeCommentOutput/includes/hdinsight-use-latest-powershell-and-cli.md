> Support for managing HDInsight resources using Azure Service Manager (ASM) through Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI is **deprecated**, and will be removed by January 1, 2017. The steps in this document use the new Azure PowerShell cmdlets and Azure CLI commands that work with Azure Resource Manager (ARM).
> 
> Please follow the steps in the [Install and Configure Azure CLI](/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-install/) and [Install and Configure Azure PowerShell](/documentation/articles/powershell-install-configure/)  to install the latest version of Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI. If you have existing scripts that need to be modified to use the new cmdlets or new CLI commands, see [Migrating to Azure Resource Manager-based development tools for HDInsight clusters](/documentation/articles/hdinsight-hadoop-development-using-azure-resource-manager/) for more information.
