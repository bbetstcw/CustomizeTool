# What do I do if my Azure subscription becomes disabled?

Your Azure subscription can become disabled for the following reasons:

### You have reached the spending limit

For more information about spending limits see [Azure Spending Limit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/). This article explains that when your usage exhausts the monthly amounts included in your offer, we will disable your service for the remainder of that billing month. It goes on to describe how you can remove your Spending Limit.

### Payment of an invoice is past due

To resolve this, see the article [Why have you received a notification that your Azure subscription has a past due balance?](/documentation/articles/billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance)

### The Azure subscription is cancelled

To reactivate a subscription, you must create a support ticket. To create a support ticket to re-enable an Azure subscription see the article [How to Create a Support Ticket for Azure Billing and Subscription Issues](/documentation/articles/billing-how-to-create-billing-support-ticket).
