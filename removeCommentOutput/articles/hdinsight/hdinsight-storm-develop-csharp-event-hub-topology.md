# Process events from Azure Event Hubs with Storm on HDInsight (C#)

Azure Event Hubs allows you to process massive amounts of data from websites, apps, and devices. The Event Hubs spout makes it easy to use Apache Storm on HDInsight to analyze this data in real time. You can also write data to Event Hubs from Storm by using the Event Hubs bolt.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Visual Studio templates installed with HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio to create two topologies that work with Azure Event Hubs.

* **EventHubWriter**: Randomly generates data and writes it to Event Hubs
* **EventHubReader**: Reads data from Event Hubs and logs the data to the Storm logs

> [AZURE.NOTE]
> While the steps in this document rely on a Windows development environment with Visual Studio, the compiled project can be submitted to either a Linux or Windows-based HDInsight cluster. __Only Linux-based clusters created after 10/28/2016 support SCP.NET topologies.__
> 
> To use a C# topology with a Linux-based cluster, you must update the Microsoft.SCP.Net.SDK NuGet package used by your project to version 0.10.0.6 or higher. The version of the package must also match the major version of Storm installed on HDInsight. For example, Storm on HDInsight versions 3.3 and 3.4 use Storm version 0.10.x, while HDInsight 3.5 uses Storm 1.0.x.
> 
> C# topologies on Linux-based clusters must use .NET 4.5, and use Mono to run on the HDInsight cluster. Most things will work, however you should check the [Mono Compatibility](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/compatibility/) document for potential incompatibilities.
> 
> For a Java version of this project, which will also work on a Linux-based or Windows-based cluster, see [Process events from Azure Event Hubs with Storm on HDInsight (Java)](/documentation/articles/hdinsight-storm-develop-java-event-hub-topology/).


## Prerequisites

* An [Apache Storm on HDInsight cluster version 3.5](/documentation/articles/hdinsight-apache-storm-tutorial-get-started/)

    > [AZURE.WARNING]
    > The example used in this document requires Storm on HDInsight version 3.5. There are changes in the classnames used for core Storm components between versions on older clusters and the version of Storm included with HDInsight 3.5. For a version of this example that works with older clusters, see [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hdinsight-dotnet-java-storm-eventhub/releases](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hdinsight-dotnet-java-storm-eventhub/releases).

* An [Azure Event Hub](/documentation/articles/event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted/)

* The [Azure .NET SDK](/downloads/)

* The [HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio](/documentation/articles/hdinsight-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/)

* [Java](https://java.com) 1.7 or greater on your development environment. Java is used to package the topology when it is submitted to the HDInsight cluster.

  * The **JAVA_HOME** environment variable must point to the directory that contains Java.
  * The **%JAVA_HOME%/bin** directory must be in the path

## Completed project

You can download a complete version of the project created in this tutorial from GitHub: [eventhub-storm-hybrid](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hdinsight-dotnet-java-storm-eventhub). However, you still need to provide configuration settings by following the steps in this tutorial.

## Event Hubs spout and bolt

The Event Hubs spout and bolt are Java components that allow you to easily work with Event Hubs from Apache Storm. Although these components are written in Java, the HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio allow you to create hybrid topologies that mix C# and Java components.

The spout and bolt are distributed as a single Java archive (.jar) file named **eventhubs-storm-spout-#.#-jar-with-dependencies.jar**, where #.# is the version of the file.

A version of the jar file that works with Storm on HDInsight version 3.5 can be downloaded from [https://000aarperiscus.blob.core.chinacloudapi.cn/certs/storm-eventhubs-1.0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar](https://000aarperiscus.blob.core.chinacloudapi.cn/certs/storm-eventhubs-1.0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar).

Create a new directory named `eventhubspout` and save the file into the directory.

## Configure Event Hubs

Event Hubs is the data source for this example. Use the information in the **Create an Event Hub** section of the [Get started with Event Hubs](/documentation/articles/event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted/) document.

1. After the event hub has been created, view the EventHub blade in the Azure Portal and select **Shared access Policies**. Use the **+ Add** entry to add the following policies:
   
   | Name | Permissions |
   | --- | --- |
   | writer |Send |
   | reader |Listen |
   
    ![policies](./media/hdinsight-storm-develop-csharp-event-hub-topology/sas.png)

2. Select the **reader** and **writer** policies. Copy and save the **PRIMARY KEY** value for both policies, as these will be used later.

## Configure the EventHubWriter

1. If you have not already installed the latest version of the HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio, see [Get started using HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio](/documentation/articles/hdinsight-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started/).

2. Download the solution from [eventhub-storm-hybrid](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hdinsight-dotnet-java-storm-eventhub). Open the solution and take a few moments to look through the code for the **EventHubWriter** project.

3. In the **EventHubWriter** project, open the **App.config** file. Use the information from the Event Hub you configured earlier to fill in the value for the following keys:
   
   | Key | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | EventHubPolicyName |writer (If you used a different name for the policy with *Send* permission, use it instead.) |
   | EventHubPolicyKey |The key for the writer policy |
   | EventHubNamespace |The namespace that contains your Event Hub |
   | EventHubName |Your Event Hub name |
   | EventHubPartitionCount |The number of partitions in your Event Hub |

4. Save and close the **App.config** file.

## Configure the EventHubReader

1. Open the **EventHubReader** project and take a few momoents to look through the code.

2. Open the **App.config** for the **EventHubWriter**. Use the information from the Event Hub you configured earlier to fill in the value for the following keys:
   
   | Key | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | EventHubPolicyName |reader (If you used a different name for the policy with *listen* permission, use it instead.) |
   | EventHubPolicyKey |The key for the reader policy |
   | EventHubNamespace |The namespace that contains your Event Hub |
   | EventHubName |Your Event Hub name |
   | EventHubPartitionCount |The number of partitions in your Event Hub |

3. Save and close the **App.config** file.

## Deploy the topologies

1. From **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **EventHubReader** project and select **Submit to Storm on HDInsight**.
   
    ![submit to storm](./media/hdinsight-storm-develop-csharp-event-hub-topology/submittostorm.png)

2. On the **Submit Topology** screen, select your **Storm Cluster**. Expand **Additional Configurations**, select **Java File Paths**, select **...** and select the directory that contains the jar file that you downloaded earlier. Finally, click **Submit**.
   
    ![Image of submission dialog](./media/hdinsight-storm-develop-csharp-event-hub-topology/submit.png)

3. When the topology has been submitted, the **Storm Topologies Viewer** will appear. Select the **EventHubReader** topology in the left pane to view statistics for the topology. Currently, nothing should be happening because no events have been written to Event Hubs yet.
   
    ![example storage view](./media/hdinsight-storm-develop-csharp-event-hub-topology/topologyviewer.png)

4. From **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **EventHubWriter** project and select **Submit to Storm on HDInsight**.

5. On the **Submit Topology** screen, select your **Storm Cluster**. Expand **Additional Configurations**, select **Java File Paths**, select **...** and select the directory that contains the jar file you downloaded earlier. Finally, click **Submit**.

6. When the topology has been submitted, refresh the topology list in the **Storm Topologies Viewer** to verify that both topologies are running on the cluster.

7. In **Storm Topologies Viewer**, select the  **EventHubReader** topology.

8. In the graph view, double-click the **LogBolt** component. This will open the **Component Summary** page for the bolt.

9. In the **Executors** section, select one of the links in the **Port** column. This will display information logged by the component. The logged information is similar to the following:

## Stop the topologies

To stop the topologies, select each topology in the **Storm Topology Viewer**, then click **Kill**.
