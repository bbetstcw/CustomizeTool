Azure Search is a hosted cloud search service that provides a search engine, search features that enable a Bing or Google-like experience in your custom application, .NET and REST APIs for integrating Azure Search with your Web or desktop application, and data storage of search-related data in the form of an *index*.

##What is an index?

An *index* is persisted storage of *documents* and other constructs used by an Azure Search service. Documents are a basic unit of searachable data. For example, a retailer might have a document for each SKU, a news organization might have a document for each article, and a streaming media organization might have a document for each video or song in their library. Mapping these concepts to more familiar database equivalents: an *index* is conceptually similar to a *table*, and *documents* are roughly equivalent to *rows* in a table.

The index that contains documents is a flat dataset -- typically a subset of the data created or captured during normal business operations through computerized processes, such as sales transactions, content publishing, purchasing acitvity -- often stored in relational or NoSQL databases. An index gets its documents when you push or pull a dataset containing rows from other data sources in your overall solution.

Understood in the narrower context of search engine operations, an index contains all searchable data used to process an index, execute a query, or return any of these: a search results list, a faceted navigation structure, a details page for  single document. In Azure Search, an index can also contain non-searchable data used internally in filter expressions or scoring profiles providing criteria used for boosting a search ranking score.

The main sections of an Azure Search index, as articulated in the JSON data interchange format, are as follows.

|Schema element|Description|
|--------------|-----------|
|Fields collection|Fields define a document. A dataset that you push or pull into an index must provide values or nulls for each field, compatible with the data type and field length expressed in the schema.|
|[Attributes](#index-attributes)|Properties or annotations on a field that specify data type, length, value, and behaviors allowed for that field. You can specify whether a field is searchable, retrievable, or sortable, all on a field-by-field basis. You can also specify language analyzer overrides at the field level.
|[Scoring profiles](https://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/dn798928.aspx)|Criteria used to boost the ranking of a search hit that has more of the characteristics set by the profile. For example, suppose a search term is matched in a product name and product description, you might want matches in product name to be ranked higher than those found in a description.|
|[Suggesters](https://msdn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/library/azure/mt131377.aspx)|Also known as auto-complete or typeahead queries, are defined as a section in the index.|
|[Default language analyzers]()|Optionally, you can be specify these at the index level, globally applicable to all fields.|
|CORS options|Optionally, enables cross-origin resource sharing, wherein requests for a resource used by a web page issued across a domain boundary. CORS is always off unless you specifically enable it for your index.|

##Index attributes

This section enumerates the attributes you can set on field definitions in an index schema.

|**Property**|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|**Retrievable**|Specifies whether a field can be returned in a search result.|
|**Filterable**|Allows the field to be used in **$filter** queries.|
|**Sortable**|Allows the field to be used as a sort column in a result set.|
|**Facetable**|Allows a field to be used in a faceted navigation structure for user self-directed filtering. Typically fields containing repetitive values that you can use to group multiple documents together (for example, multiple documents that fall under a single brand or service category) work best as facets.|
|**Key**|A string that provides the unique ID of each document, used for document look up. Every index must have one key. Only one field can be the key, and it must be set to Edm.String.|
|**Searchable**|Marks the field as full-text searchable.|


##When do I create an index?

As part of provisioning a search service for use by your application, you'll need to create an index. Creating an index is a task mostly centered on defining its schema. Minimally, it consists of defining fields and setting attributes. Optionally, you can extend an index to include scoring profiles, suggestions, and customized default values.

To create a schema that defines an index, you can use the portal or write code that calls into the .NET SDK or REST API. 

Once you define the schema and create the index, populating it is a separate operation. For more about data ingestion after the index is created, see [Import data to Azure Search](/documentation/articles/search-what-is-data-import).

##How are indexes used in Azure Search?

All data-related operations performed by Azure Search consume or return data from an index. There are no exceptions: you cannot point the service to other data sources besides the index to return external data in a response emitted by your search service.

For applications that accumulate and operate on data, such as sales transactions of an online retail app, an Azure Search index will be an additional data source in your overall solution. The index is dedicated data storage used only by your search service. Having dedicated data source with proximity to your search service ensures consistency in search results, reduces volatility, reduces the number round trips between your application and Azure Search, and improves overall performance of search operations because there is no competition for resources or data.

##Guidance for defining an schema

Schemas are created as JSON structures. You should create one index for each custom solution that you integrate with Azure Search. You cannot link or join multiple indexes, but you can create complex indexes that accommodate a range of search scenarios required by your solution. For example, if your applications support multiple languages, the fields collection in your index could have language-specific variants for each field.

As you design your index, take your time in the planning phase to think through each decision. Changing an index after it is deployed involves rebuilding and reloading the data. If you create the index in code, this step will be much easier than if you create it manually in the portal.

Having a solid understanding of the original source data is essential to creating a good schema. You will want to match up data types, know which field to use as a *key* that uniquely identifies each document in the index, and which fields should be exposed in a search results list or detail page. 

Image, audio, or video content should be stored elsewhere as long as the index includes a representative field with a URL to the resource. Any content, especially binary content, that is not searchable should be stored in cheaper storage, and then referenced by URI in a field in your index.

As you can imagine, the index must be regularly synchronized with other data sources used in your solution. In an online retail catalog, the inventory database that captures sales transactions must have the same SKUs, pricing, and availability as the data surfaced via search results. Depending on how much latency is acceptable for your solution, you might find that data synchronization can be once a week, once a day, or in near real-time using concurrent writes to both an inventory database and an Azure Search index. [Import data to Azure Search](/documentation/articles/search-what-is-data-import) explains the available options in detail.

## Storage in the cloud

Because Azure Search is a fully-managed search service, data storage is handled as an internal operation. As a programmer, it's important to understand that you cannot bypass the Azure Search APIs to connect to the index directly, nor can you monitor index size or health except through portal notifications or API calls. There is no facility for backing up or restoring an index, nor for optimizing or tuning performance at the storage layer. Behind the scenes, data is stored as blob storage, but the best way to think about the physical storage and management of an index is as an implementation detail that could change in the future. One of the primary benefits of the service is  the hands-off approach to physically managing the compute resources of your search application.

If query volume or data storage requirements change over time, you can increase or decrease capacity by adding or moving replicas and partitions. For details, see [Manage your Search service in Azure](/documentation/articles/search-manage) or [Service Limits](/documentation/articles/search-limits-quotas-capacity).
