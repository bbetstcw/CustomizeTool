>[AZURE.IMPORTANT]Before you work with Azure resources, it's important to understand that Azure currently has two deployment models: Resource Manager, and classic. Make sure you understand [deployment models and tools](/documentation/articles/azure-classic-rm/) before working with any Azure resource. You can view the documentation for different tools by clicking the tabs at the top of this article. This document covers creating a VNet by using the classic deployment model. You can also [create a virtual network in the Resource Manager deployment model by using the Azure portal Preview](/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-create-vnet-arm-pportal/).
