# Understanding NoSQL on Windows Azure

Are you curious about the array of NoSQL technologies available in Azure, but aren't sure how they differ from each other or the relational models available? Or maybe you've got specific data in mind, but aren't sure which NoSQL technology is best for your application. If so, take advantage of the key learnings David Chappell provides in this insightful whitepaper. 

This whitepaper walks you through the following:

 - Differentiating operational data, which is read and written by applications, from analytical data, which is used to provide business intelligence (BI), to help determine the right technology for your needs.
 - A quick review of relational technology.
 - An introduction to each of the Azure NoSQL technologies: DocumentDB, Table storage, HBase, and HDInsight.
 - A comparison of the NoSQL technologies and Azure SQL Database. 
 - When to use DocumentDB vs. Table storage vs. HBase vs. HDInsight vs. SQL Database.
