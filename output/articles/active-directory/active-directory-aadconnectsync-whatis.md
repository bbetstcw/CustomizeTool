# Azure AD Connect sync: Understand and customize synchronization

The Azure Active Directory Connect synchronization services (Azure AD Connect sync) is a main component of Azure AD Connect that takes care of all the operations that are related to synchronizing identity data between your on-premises environment and Azure AD in the cloud. From a synchronization perspective, Azure AD Connect sync is the successor of DirSync, Azure AD Sync and Forefront Identity Manager with the Azure Active Directory Connector configured.
