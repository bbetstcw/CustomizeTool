#How do I purchase Azure Support?
Azure offers flexible support options for all customers, from developers starting their journey in the cloud to enterprises deploying business critical applications. Support for billing and subscription management issues is offered free of charge while you will need to purchase an Azure Support subscription to engage Azure Technical support.

For more information about Azure subscriptions available for purchase, click [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details/). To purchase technical support, visit the [Azure Support Plans page](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/).  

There are also self-help resources available. You can view the Azure support [FAQ](/support/faq/) here, and access support articles from the Documentation tab on any Azure.com page.
