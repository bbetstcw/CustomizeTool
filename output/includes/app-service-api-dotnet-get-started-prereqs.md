### ASP.NET Web API

The tutorial assumes that you have a basic knowledge of how to work with ASP.NET [Web API 2](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/tutorial-your-first-web-api) and [MVC 5](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started) in Visual Studio.

### Visual Studio 2015

The instructions and screen shots assume you're using Visual Studio 2015, but the same guidance works for Visual Studio 2013.

### Azure account

You need an Azure account to complete the tutorial. You can:

* [Open an Azure account for free](/pricing/1rmb-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). You get credits that can be used to try out paid Azure services. Even after the credits are used up, you can keep the account and use free Azure services and features, such as the Web Apps feature in Azure Web App.
* [Activate Visual Studio subscriber benefits](/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). Your MSDN subscription gives you credits every month that you can use for paid Azure services.

If you want to get started with Azure before you sign up for an Azure account, go to [Try Azure Web App](https://tryappservice.azure.com/). There, you can immediately create a short-lived starter  app in Azure â no credit card required, and no commitments.
