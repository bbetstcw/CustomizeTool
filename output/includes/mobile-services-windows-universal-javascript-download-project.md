This tutorial is built on the [GetStartedWithMobileServices app](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com:443/Get-Started-with-Data-in-0e863e57), which is a universal Windows app project in Visual Studio 2013. The UI for this app is identical to the app generated by the Mobile Services quickstart, except that added items are stored locally in memory. 

1. Download the JavaScript version of the GetStartedWithMobileServices sample app from the [Developer Code Samples site].
