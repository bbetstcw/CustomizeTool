# Deploy popular application frameworks using Azure Resource Manager templates

Workloads usually require many resources to function according to design. Azure Resource Manager templates make it possible for you to not only define how applications are configured, but also how the resources are deployed to support configured applications. This article introduces you to the most popular templates in the gallery and gives you information for using the Azure  portal, Azure  CLI, or PowerShell to deploy them. You can also [see the Windows version of this topic](/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-app-frameworks/).
