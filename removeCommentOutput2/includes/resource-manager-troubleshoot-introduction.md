You can troubleshoot your deployment by looking at either the audit logs, or the deployment operations. This topic shows both methods.

You can avoid some errors by validating your template and infrastructure prior to deployment. For more information, see [Deploy a resource group with Azure Resource Manager template](../articles/resource-group-template-deploy.md).

For help with resolving particular deployment errors, see [Resolve common errors when deploying resources to Azure with Azure Resource Manager](../articles/resource-manager-common-deployment-errors.md).
