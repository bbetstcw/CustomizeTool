## Create an IoT hub

You need to create an IoT Hub for you simulated device to connect to. The following steps show you how to complete this task using the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal][lnk-portal].

2. In the Jumpbar, click **New**, then click **Internet of Things**, and then click **Azure IoT Hub**.

3. In the **IoT hub** blade, choose the configuration for your IoT hub.

    * In the **Name** box, enter a name for your IoT hub. If the **Name** is valid and available, a green check mark appears in the **Name** box.
    * Select a [Pricing and scale tier][lnk-pricing]. This tutorial does not require a specific tier. For this tutorial, we recommend you use the free F1 tier.
    * In **Resource group**, create a new resource group, or select an existing one. For more information, see [Using resource groups to manage your Azure resources][lnk-resource-groups].
    * In **Location**, select the location to host your IoT hub. For this tutorial, we recommend you choose your closest location.

4. When you have chosen your IoT hub configuration options, click **Create**.  It can take a few minutes for Azure to create your IoT hub. To check the status, you can monitor the progress on the Startboard or in the Notifications panel.

5. When the IoT hub has been created successfully, click on the new tile for your IoT hub in the portal to open the blade for the new IoT hub. Make a note of the **Hostname**, and then click the **Keys** icon.

6. In the **Shared access policy** blade, click the **iothubowner** policy, then copy and make note of the connection string in the **iothubowner** blade. See [Access control][lnk-access-control] in the "Azure IoT Hub developer guide" for more information.
