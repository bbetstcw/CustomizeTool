# What is Application Gateway?


Windows Azure Application Gateway provides an Azure-managed HTTP load-balancing solution based on layer-7 load balancing.

Application load balancing enables IT administrators and developers to create routing rules for network traffic based on HTTP.  The application gateway service is highly available and metered. For the SLA and pricing, refer to the [SLA](/support/legal/sla/) and [Pricing](/home/features/application-gateway/#price) pages.

Application Gateway currently supports layer-7 application delivery for the following:

- HTTP load balancing
- Cookie-based session affinity
- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) offload

HTTP layer-7 load balancing is useful for:

- Applications that require requests from the same user/client session to reach the same back-end VM. Examples of this would be shopping cart apps and web mail servers.
- Applications that want to free web server farms from SSL termination overhead.
- Applications, such as a content delivery network, that require multiple HTTP requests on the same long-running TCP connection to be routed or load balanced to different back-end servers.


## Gateway sizes and instances

Application Gateway is currently offered in three sizes: Small, Medium, and Large. Small instance sizes are intended for development and testing scenarios.

You can create up to 50 application gateways per subscription, and each application gateway can have up to 10 instances each. Application Gateway load balancing as an Azure-managed service allows the provisioning of a layer-7 load balancer behind the Azure software load balancer.

The table below shows an average performance throughput for each application gateway instance:


| Back-end page response | Small | Medium | Large|
|---|---|---|---|
| 6K | 7.5 Mbps | 13 Mbps | 50 Mbps |
|100K | 35 Mbps | 100 Mbps| 200 Mbps |


>[AZURE.NOTE] This is an approximate guidance for an application gateway throughput. The actual throughput is dependent on various environment details, such as average page size, location of back-end instances, and processing time to serve a page.

## Health monitoring


Azure Application Gateway automatically monitors the health of the back-end instances. For more information, see [Application Gateway health monitoring overview](/documentation/articles/application-gateway-probe-overview).

## Configuring and managing

You can create and manage an application gateway by using REST APIs and by using PowerShell cmdlets.



## Next steps
