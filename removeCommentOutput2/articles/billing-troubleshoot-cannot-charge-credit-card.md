# I received an email that my services might be interrupted

If we are unable to process your payment for some reason, you might receive an email with a message similar to:

**We have been unable to charge your credit card for your subscription. To prevent any service interruptions, please update your payment information.**

This can occur if your account is past due. If so, see this article for instructions to make a credit card or invoice payment:
[Why have you received a notification that your Azure subscription has a past due balance](/documentation/articles/billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance).

If you need help or have questions, you can always contact [Azure Support](https://manage.windowsazure.cn/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade). If you need help opening a ticket see [How to create a support ticket for Azure billing and subscription issues](/documentation/articles/billing-how-to-create-billing-support-ticket).
