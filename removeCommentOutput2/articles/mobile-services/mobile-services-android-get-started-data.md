# Add Mobile Services to an existing Android app (JavaScript backend)

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-service-note-mobile-apps](../includes/mobile-services-note-mobile-apps.md)]

## Summary



<p>This tutorial helps you understand in more detail how Azure Mobile Services can store and retrieve data from an Android app. So it walks you through many of the steps that are already completed for you in the Mobile Services quickstart tutorial. If this is your first experience with Mobile Services, consider first completing the tutorial <a href="/documentation/articles/mobile-services-javascript-backend-windows-store-dotnet-get-started-android">Get started with Mobile Services</a>.</p>

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

- an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see <a href="/pricing/1rmb-trial/" target="_blank">Azure Trial</a>.


- the [Azure Mobile Services Android SDK];
- the <a  href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">Android Studio integrated development environment</a>, which includes the Android SDK; and Android 4.2 or a later version. The downloaded GetStartedWithData project requires Android 4.2 or a later version. However, the Mobile Services SDK requires only Android 2.2 or a later version.

## Sample Code

To see the completed source code, go <a href="https://github.com/Azure/mobile-services-samples/tree/master/GettingStartedWithData/AndroidStudio">here</a>.

## Download the GetStartedWithData project

###Get the sample code

[AZURE.INCLUDE [download-android-sample-code](../includes/download-android-sample-code.md)]

###Inspect and run the sample code

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-android-run-sample-code](../includes/mobile-services-android-run-sample-code.md)]

## Create a new mobile service in the Azure Management Portal

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-service-data](../includes/mobile-services-create-new-service-data.md)]

## Add a new table to the mobile service

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-service-data-2](../includes/mobile-services-create-new-service-data-2.md)]

## Update the app to use the mobile service for data access

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-android-getting-started-with-data](../includes/mobile-services-android-getting-started-with-data.md)]


## Test the app against your new mobile service

Now that the app has been updated to use Mobile Services for back end storage, you can test it against Mobile Services, using either the Android emulator or an Android phone.

1. From the **Run** menu, click **Run app** to start the project.

	This executes your app, built with the Android SDK, that uses the client library to send a query that returns items from your mobile service.

2. As before, type meaningful text, then click **Add**.

   	This sends a new item as an insert to the mobile service.

3. In the [Azure Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your mobile service.

4. Click the **Data** tab, then click **Browse**.

   	![][9]

   	Notice that the **TodoItem** table now contains data, with some values generated by Mobile Services, and that columns have been automatically added to the table to match the TodoItem class in the app.

This concludes the **Get started with data** tutorial for Android.

## Troubleshooting

###Verify Android SDK Version

## Next steps

This tutorial demonstrated the basics of enabling an Android app to work with data in Mobile Services.

Next, consider completing one of the following tutorials that is based on the GetStartedWithData app that you created in this tutorial:

* [Validate and modify data with scripts]
  <br/>Learn more about using server scripts in Mobile Services to validate and change data sent from your app.

* [Refine queries with paging]
  <br/>Learn how to use paging in queries to control the amount of data handled in a single request.

Once you have completed the data series, try these other Android tutorials:

* [Get started with authentication]
	<br/>Learn how to authenticate users of your app.

* [Get started with push notifications]
  <br/>Learn how to send a very basic push notification to your app with Mobile Services.
