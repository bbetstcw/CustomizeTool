This tutorial shows how to create a Java [web app in Azure Websites](/documentation/services/web-sites/) by using the [Azure preview portal](https://manage.windowsazure.cn/). The Azure preview portal is a web interface that you can use to manage Azure resources.

> [AZURE.NOTE] To complete this tutorial, you need a Windows Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can [activate your MSDN subscriber benefits][] or [sign up for a trial][].
>
> If you want to get started with Azure Websites before you sign up for an Azure account, go to [Try Azure Websites][]. There, you can immediately create a short-lived starter web app in Azure Websitesâ€”no credit card required, and no commitments.

## Java application options

10. Click **Application settings**.

11. Choose the desired **Java version**. 
1. Log in to the Windows Azure Management Portal.
2. Click **New**, click **Compute**, click **Website**, and then click **Quick Create**.

15. Click the **URL** to browse to the new site.

	The web page confirms that you have created a Java-based web app.

## Next steps

At this point, you have a Java application server running in your web app in Azure Websites. To deploy your own code to the web app, see [Add an application or webpage to your Java web app](/documentation/articles/web-sites-java-add-app).
