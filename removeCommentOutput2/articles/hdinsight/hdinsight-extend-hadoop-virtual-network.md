#Extend HDInsight capabilities by using Azure Virtual Network

Azure Virtual Network allows you to extend your Hadoop solutions to incorporate on-premises resources such as SQL Server, or to create secure private networks between resources in the cloud.

> [AZURE.NOTE] HDInsight does not support affinity-based Azure virtual networks. When using HDInsight, you must use location-based virtual networks.


##<a id="whatis"></a>What is Azure Virtual Network?

[Azure Virtual Network](/documentation/services/networking/) allows you to create a secure, persistent network containing the resources you need for your solution. A virtual network allows you to:

* Connect cloud resources together in a private network (cloud-only).

	Using Virtual Network to link Azure services with Azure HDInsight enables the following scenarios:

	* **Invoking HDInsight services or jobs** from Azure websites or services running in Azure virtual machines.

	* **Directly transferring data** between HDInsight and Azure SQL Database, SQL Server, or another data storage solution running on a virtual machine.

	* **Combining multiple HDInsight servers** into a single solution. An example is using an HDInsight Storm server to consume incoming data, and then storing the processed data to an HDInsight HBase server. The raw data might also be stored to an HDInsight Hadoop server for future analysis by using MapReduce.

* Connect your cloud resources to your local datacenter network (site-to-site or point-to-site) by using a virtual private network (VPN).

	Site-to-site configuration allows you to connect multiple resources from your datacenter to the Azure virtual network by using a hardware VPN or the Routing and Remote Access service.

	Point-to-site configuration allows you to connect a specific resource to the Azure virtual network by using software VPN.

	Using Virtual Network to link the cloud and your datacenter enables similar scenarios to the cloud-only configuration. But instead of being limited to working with resources in the cloud, you can also work with resources in your datacenter.

	* **Directly transferring data** between HDInsight and your datacenter. An example is using Sqoop to transfer data to or from SQL Server or reading data generated by a line-of-business (LOB) application.

	* **Invoking HDInsight services or jobs** from an LOB application. An example is using HBase Java APIs to store and retrieve data from an HDInsight HBase cluster.

For more information on Virtual Network features, benefits, and capabilities, see the [Azure Virtual Network overview](/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-overview).

> [AZURE.NOTE] You must create the Azure Virtual Network before provisioning an HDInsight cluster. For more information, see [Virtual Network configuration tasks](/documentation/services/networking/).

## Virtual Network requirements

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Creating an HDInsight cluster on a Virtual Network requires specific Virtual Network configurations, which are described in this section.

###Location-based Virtual networks

Azure HDInsight supports only location-based virtual networks, and does not currently work with virtual networks based on affinity group. 

###Subnets

It is highly recommended that you create a single subnet for each HDInsight cluster. 

###Secured Virtual Networks

HDInsight is not supported on Azure Virtual Networks that explicitly restrict access to/from the Internet. For example, using Network Security Groups or ExpressRoute to block Internet traffic to resources in the Virtual Network. The HDInsight service is a managed service, and requires Internet access during provisioning and while running so that Azure can monitor the health of the cluster, initiate failover of cluster resources, and other automated management tasks.

If you want to use HDInsight on a Virtual Network that blocks Internet traffic, you can use the following steps:

1. Create a new subnet within the Virtual Network. By default, the new subnet will be able to communicate with the Internet. This allows HDInsight to be installed on this subnet. Since the new subnet is in the same virtual network as the secured subnet(s), it can also communicate with resources installed there.

2. Create the HDInsight cluster. When configuring the Virtual Network settings for the cluster, select the subnet created in step 1.

##<a id="tasks"></a>Tasks and information

This section contains information on common tasks and information you may need when using HDInsight with a virtual network.

###Verify network connectivity

Some services, such as SQL Server, can limit incoming network connections. This will prevent HDInsight from successfully working with these services.

If you encounter problems accessing a service from HDInsight, consult the documentation for the service to ensure that you have enabled network access. You can also verify network access by creating an Azure virtual machine on the same virtual network, and use client utilities to verify that the virtual machine can connect to the service over the virtual network.
