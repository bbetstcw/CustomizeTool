		2. Supply a **Location** for your service. In general, choose a Location closest to the geographical region where you want to deploy your device. You may also want to factor in the following: 
			 
				- If you have existing workloads in Azure that you also intend to deploy with your StorSimple device, you should use that datacenter.
				- Your StorSimple Manager service and Azure storage can be in two separate locations. In such a case, you are required to create the StorSimple Manager and Azure storage account separately. To create an Azure storage account, go to the Azure Storage service in the Management Portal and follow the steps in [Create an Azure Storage account](/documentation/articles/storage-create-storage-account#create-a-storage-account). After you create this account, add it to the StorSimple Manager service by following the steps in [Configure a new storage account for the service](/documentation/articles/storsimple-deployment-walkthrough#configure-a-new-storage-account-for-the-service).
