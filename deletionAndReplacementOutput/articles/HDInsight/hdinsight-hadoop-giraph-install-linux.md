		This data describes a relationship between objects in a directed graph, by using the format [source\_id, source\_value,[[dest\_id], [edge\_value],...]]. Each line represents a relationship between a **source\_id** object and one or more **dest\_id** objects. The **edge\_value** (or weight) can be thought of as the strength or distance of the connection between **source_id** and **dest\_id**.
