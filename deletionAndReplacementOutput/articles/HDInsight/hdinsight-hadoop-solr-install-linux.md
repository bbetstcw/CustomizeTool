		The Solr dashboard is a web UI that allows you to work with Solr through your web browser. The Solr dashboard is not exposed directly on the Internet from your HDInsight cluster, but must be accessed using an SSH tunnel. For more information on using an SSH tunnel, see [Use SSH Tunneling to access Ambari web UI, ResourceManager, JobHistory, NameNode, Oozie, and other web UI's](/documentation/articles/hdinsight-linux-ambari-ssh-tunnel)
