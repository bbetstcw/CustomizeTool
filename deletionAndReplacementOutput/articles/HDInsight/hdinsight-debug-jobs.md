		Some of these error messages could also be seen in the Azure preview portal when it is used to manage HDInsight clusters. But other error messages you might encounter there are less granular due to the constraints on the remedial actions possible in this context. Other error messages are provided in the contexts where the mitigation is obvious. If the constraints on parameters are violated, for example, the message pops-up in on the right side of the box where the value was entered. Here is a case where too many data nodes have been requested. The remedy is to reduce the number to an allowed value that is 33 or less.

		In situations where the error is specific to Azure HDInsight, it might be a good idea to understand what the error is about. Refer to [HDInsight error codes](#hdi-error-codes) to understand the different error codes, and how to fix those. In some situations, you might want to access the Hadoop logs itself. You can do so directly from the Azure preview portal.
