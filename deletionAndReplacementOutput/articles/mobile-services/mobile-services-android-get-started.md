		5. Now download your app:
			- The latest app version uses the Mobile Services Android SDK 2.0. You can download that version from <a href="https://github.com/RickSaling/mobile-services-samples/tree/futures">here</a>. Click **Download Zip**, unzip it, and the project is in GettingStarted under the Android folder.
			 
			- An earlier version uses the prior version of the SDK. To use it, under **Download and run your app**, click **Download**. This downloads the project for the sample _To do list_ application that is connected to your mobile service. The project files are compressed, so browse to their location and expand the files on your computer.
