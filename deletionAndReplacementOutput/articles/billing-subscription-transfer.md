		-   **How do I use this mechanism to change the directory for subscription?**-   
		    An Azure subscription is created in the directory that the Account Admin belongs to. So, in order to change the directory, just transfer the subscription to a user account in the target directory. When that user completes the steps to accept transfer, the subscription will automatically move to the target directory.
