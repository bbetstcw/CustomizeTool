		### Promote Your Application in the Azure and Office 365 Marketplaces
		
		**Promote your application to the millions of organizations who are already using Azure AD.**  Users who search and browse these marketplaces are already using one or more cloud services, making them qualified cloud service customers.  Learn more about promoting your application in [the Azure Marketplace](http://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partner-program/).
		
		**When users sign up for your application, it will appear in their Azure AD access panel and Office 365 app launcher.**  Users will be able to quickly and easily return to your application later, improving user engagement.  Learn more about the [Azure AD access panel](/documentation/articles/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
