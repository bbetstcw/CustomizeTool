		### Geo-redundant service deployment
		
		Azure Scheduler is available via the UI in almost every geo region that's in Azure today. The list of regions that Azure Scheduler is available in is [listed here](http://azure.microsoft.com/regions/#services). If a data center in a hosted region is rendered unavailable, the failover capabilities of Azure Scheduler are such that the service is available from another data center.
