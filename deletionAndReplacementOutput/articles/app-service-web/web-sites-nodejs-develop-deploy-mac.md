		[Git](http://git-scm.com/%20target="_blank) is a distributed version control system that you can use to deploy your Azure Website. You'll store the code you write for your web app in a local Git repository, and you'll deploy your code to Azure by pushing to a remote repository. This method of deployment is a feature of Azure Websites web apps.  
		
		1. Sign in to the [Azure preview portal](https://manage.windowsazure.cn).
		
		2. Click the **+ NEW** icon on the top left of the portal.
		
		3. Click **Web + Mobile**, and then click **Web app**.
		
		    ![][portal-quick-create]
		
		4. Enter a name for the web app in the **Web app** box.
		
			This name must be unique in the chinacloudsites.cn domain because the URL of the web app will be {name}.chinacloudsites.cn. If the name you enter isn't unique, a red exclamation mark appears in the text box.
		
		5. Select a **Resource Group** or create a new one.
		
			For more information about resource groups, see [Using the Azure Preview Portal to manage your Azure resources](/documentation/articles/resource-group-portal).
		
		5. Select an **App Service plan/Location** or create a new one.
		
			For more information about App Service plans, see [App Service plans overview](/documentation/articles/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview)
		
		6. Click **Create**.
		   
			![][portal-quick-create2]
		
			In a short time, typically less than a minute, Azure finishes creating the new web app.
		
		7. Click **Web apps > {your new web app}**.
		
			![](./media/web-sites-nodejs-develop-deploy-mac/gotowebapp.png)
		
		8. In the **Web app** blade, click the **Deployment** part.
		
			![][deployment-part]
		
		9. In the **Continuous Deployment** blade, click **Choose Source**
		
		14. Click **Local Git Repository**, and then click **OK**.
		
			![][setup-git-publishing]
		
		11. Set up deployment credentials if you haven't already done so.
		
			a. In the Web app blade, click **Settings > Deployment credentials**.
		
			![][deployment-credentials]
		 
			b. Create a user name and password. 
			
			![](./media/web-sites-nodejs-develop-deploy-mac/setdeploycreds.png)
		
		11. In the Web app blade, click **Settings**, and then click **Properties**.
		 
			To publish, you'll push to a remote Git repository. The URL for the repository is listed under **GIT URL**. You'll use this URL later in the tutorial.

Instead, a Git repository will be created using the user name and password you previously specified. Make a note of the user name and password, as they will be used for Git publishing to all Azure Websites you create.
