		This article describes how to navigate and select virtual machine images, using a recent installation of either the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell. As a prerequisite, you would need to change to the Resource Manager mode. With the Azure CLI, enter that mode by typing `azure config mode arm`. With PowerShell, type `Switch-AzureMode AzureResourceManager`. See [Using Azure CLI with Resource Manager](/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-azure-resource-manager) and [Using Azure PowerShell with Azure Resource Manager](/documentation/articles/powershell-azure-resource-manager) for more complete update and configuration details.
