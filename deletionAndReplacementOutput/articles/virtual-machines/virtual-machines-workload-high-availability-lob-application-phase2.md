		> [AZURE.NOTE] Because these virtual machines are for an intranet application, they are not assigned a public IP address or a DNS domain name label and exposed to the Internet. However, this also means that you cannot connect to them from the Azure Preview portal. The **Connect** button will be unavailable when you view the properties of the virtual machine. Use the Remote Desktop Connection accessory or another Remote Desktop tool to connect to the virtual machine using its private IP address or intranet DNS name.
