		### Graphical runbook samples
		
		You add a **Get-AutomationConnection** activity to a graphical runbook by right-clicking on the connection in the Library pane of the graphical editor and selecting **Add to canvas**.

		The following image shows an example of using a connection in a graphical runbook.  This is the same example shown above for sending a text message using Twilio from a textual runbook.  This example uses the **UseConnectionObject** parameter set for the **Send-TwilioSMS** activity that uses a connection object for authentication to the service.  A [pipeline link](/documentation/articles/automation-graphical-authoring-intro#links-and-workflow) is used here since the Connection parameter is expecting a single object.
		
		The reason that a PowerShell expression is used for the value in the **To** parameter instead of a Constant value is that this parameter expects a string array value type so that you can send to multiple numbers.  A PowerShell expression allows you to provide a single value or an array.

		The image below shows the same example as above but uses the **SpecifyConnectionFields** parameter set that expects the AccountSid and AuthToken parameters to be specified individually as opposed to using a connection object for authentication.  In this case, fields of the connection are specified instead of the object itself.
